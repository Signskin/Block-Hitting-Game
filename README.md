# Block-Hitting-Game
This is a block hitting game demo, as well as my personal trial to the library *SDL2*.

Well actually this is part of the final assignment of the cource *Introduction to Computer Science* and is finished within 3 days, therefore there might be a lot of bug hiding somewhere.

You can use this project to do whatever you want (within the authorization range of SDL2 library), even to hand in as your homework.
**But this is not recommended and not encouraged in any sense! There are a few of our mates failed becauce they just use the code on github and unfortunately copied codes of other students.**
Also, one should be responsible for one's moral principle.

## Complie Instruction
### Required Libraries
`SDL2`
`SDL2_ttf`

Notice that these are two different libraries that should be downloaded sperately. Luckily, they can all be found on github.
I have tried static linking but it seems that it will fail (don't know reason for now anyway).

### Compile Environment
I use `g++` on Windows, but you can certainly use other complier. Also, libraries mentioned above are also supported under Ubuntu (more convenient in fact) but it requires display drivers.

Place header and bin library under correct path regarding your compiler, and place the dynamic library under code path. Then run the bat!

`g++ (MinGW-W64 x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders) 13.1.0` only for reference.
